    "#1.What is Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is a method of machine translation that uses statistical models to translate text from one language to another. It relies on large amounts of bilingual text data (corpora) to build probabilistic models that determine the most likely translation for a given sentence or phrase. SMT works by analyzing word or phrase alignments between languages and using these alignments to generate translations. Unlike rule-based systems, SMT does not require linguistic rules but instead learns patterns from data, improving over time with more training data."
